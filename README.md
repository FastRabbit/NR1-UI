## [1. Installation steps]
---
Step 1: Download Volumio

a) Download Raspberry Pi Imager: 
Go to the Raspberry Pi website (www.raspberrypi.org) and download the Raspberry Pi Imager for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Install the imager on your computer.

b) Insert the SD card: 
Insert the SD card into your computer's SD card reader.

c) Launch Raspberry Pi Imager: 
Open the Raspberry Pi Imager software that you installed in step 1.

d) Select the operating system: 
In Raspberry Pi Imager, click on "Choose OS" and scroll down to find "Media Player OS" in the list. Then select "Volumio" from the options.

e) Choose the target storage: 
Click on "Choose SD Card" and select the SD card that you inserted in step 2. Make sure to choose the correct one, as the imager will erase all data on the selected card.

f) Write the image: 
Click on "Write" to start writing the Volumio image to the SD card. This process may take a few minutes to complete.

g) Eject the SD card: 
Once the writing process is finished, safely eject the SD card from your computer.
